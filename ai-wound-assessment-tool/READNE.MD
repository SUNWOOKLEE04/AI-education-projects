AI-Powered Smart Bandage Assessment Tool

Project Period: April 14–21, 2025 (7-day sprint)  
Team: Mentoring collaboration (IT planner) and a pre-med student  
Key Innovation: A solution that connects a physical bandage product with QR code to an AI-powered web assessment tool

---

Project Overview  
This project delivers an end-to-end healthcare IT solution where every smart bandage package includes a QR code. When users take and upload wound images, the web platform uses AI to analyze visual wound features and suggests care tips and optimal bandage replacement timing. The platform was ideated, prototyped, and completed within a one-week intensive real-world learning sprint.
